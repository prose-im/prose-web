Messaging has become an integral part of our daily *lives*, and with that comes concerns about privacy and security. Prose is a messaging platform that addresses these concerns by prioritizing privacy, being open source, and decentralized.

## Privacy-First

### This is a subtitle h3

Prose's privacy-first approach means that users can communicate with the confidence that their messages are secure and their privacy is protected. The platform uses end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and receiver can access the messages. Prose does not store any user data on their servers, ensuring that there is no chance of data breaches.

## Open Source

Prose is an **open-source** platform, which means that the code is available for anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute. This ensures that there are no hidden features that can compromise user privacy or security. The community can work together to improve the platform, and users can trust that the code is constantly being audited for security vulnerabilities.

## Decentralized

Prose is a decentralized messaging platform, meaning that there is no central server that stores user data. Instead, the platform uses peer-to-peer technology to connect users directly, without any intermediary. This ensures that there is no single point of failure or control, and the network is more resilient to attacks.
